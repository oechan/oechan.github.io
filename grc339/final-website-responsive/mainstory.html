                                <p>There is much to be said about global cuisine and culinary culture; each region and country has its own signature dishes and culinary heritage that merit exploration and appreciation. It is through cultural integration that we can discover the delicious flavors of international cuisine. The traditional, regional cuisine of a country can tell us a lot about their cultural heritage, the resources available to them, and who has influenced their culture. Please explore the international cuisine resources listed below for more information and recipes specific to select areas and countries from around the world.</p>

                                <p>From Italian to Indian to Japanese to French to Mexican, international influences are and always have been a major force in the development of American cuisine. At the same time, “American cuisine” can feel like a pretty reductive term, considering the diverse and hyper-local dishes and dining traditions present in smaller regions of the U.S.</p>

                                <p>Mediterranean food is one of the cuisines that are really easy to make or pick up at a local restaurant. The main ingredients are fresh and a good option if you are looking for something healthy to eat. Some of the dishes include, gyros, meat kebabs, and stews. The key ingredients are olives, wheat, and grapes which are easy to find at any local grocery store. The cooking of the area is not to be confused with the Mediterranean diet, made popular because of the apparent health benefits of a diet rich in olive oil, wheat and other grains, fruits, vegetables, and a certain amount of seafood, but low in meat and dairy products. Mediterranean cuisine encompasses the ways that these and other ingredients, including meat, are dealt with in the kitchen, whether they are health-giving or not.</p>

                                <p>Another great cuisine that has inspired many American dishes is food from Italy. Some of the most widely eaten dishes originated from here from pizza, to the all the different kinds of pasta dishes. Dried pasta, sauce, vegetables, and meat are the key ingredients for cooking up a classic Italian dish. Italian cuisine is generally characterized by its simplicity, with many dishes having only two to four main ingredients.[12] Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation.[13] Ingredients and dishes vary by region. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated with variations throughout the country.</p>

                                <p>Last but not least, you can take your flavors to Asia, and cook yourself up some good Chinese, Japanese, Thai food, etc.. Some the key ingredients found in these cuisines are red pepper, soy sauce, meat, sesame oil, and vegetables. Thai food and Chinese food have been especially popular around the world and are not hard to make!Thai cooking places emphasis on lightly prepared dishes with strong aromatic components and a spicy edge.Traditional Thai cuisine loosely falls into four categories: tom (boiled dishes), yam (spicy salads), tam (pounded foods), and gaeng (curries). Deep-fries, stir-fries, and steamed dishes derive from Chinese cooking.</p>

                                <p>There are hundreds of other cuisines out there and recipes curated from people around the world that make cooking authentic dishes easy and accessible.
